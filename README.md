# OpenIO
Open source (network) IO controller.

Currently a placeholder for an upcoming project.
If you like the idea, please star this project, to give it priority!
Also, use the "Issues tab" to discuss features and/or ideas.

The idea is to create a device such as the Arduino but then with either: ethernet, wifi, zigbee (or other type or RF) or RS485 and create an application layer protocol that defines a way to get/set inputs.

This, to easily add I/O to any server.
A proof of concept of this, will be an NodeJS home automation server.
